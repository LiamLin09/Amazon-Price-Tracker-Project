Amazon Price Tracker Project

- Python bot is going to be the one that's going to be constantly checking
- when the time is right, it is going to be the one that's going to alert us, using an email
- the idea here is our little Python body is going to have a set time,
- it is going to look at a specific thing on that webpage, which is the price.
- when the price is below our set target of a hundred dollars, its going to send us an email and give us an alert
